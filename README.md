## Path Finder Using A* Algorithm

# Description
The A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm is an efficient search algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a grid or graph. Combining the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and a heuristic approach, A* is widely used in various applications requiring optimal pathfinding solutions.
This algorithm efficiently finds the shortest distance between a start and an end node in a given grid.

This tool provides an interactive interface to demonstrate how the A* algorithm works in real-time.
